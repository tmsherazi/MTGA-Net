Breast cancer, recognized as a leading health threat among women globally, underscores the need for innovations in early detection and diagnostic methods. Traditional mammography, despite being widely used, suffers from time-consuming processes and variability in interpretation. This study aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of breast mass classification in mammographic images by developing and validating two innovative Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems utilizing deep learning techniques.
The study introduces the Multi-tier Global-attention Network (MTGA-Net), designed to enhance feature representation by integrating both local feature extraction and global context information. The system is based on the ResNet152V3 backbone and utilizes global pooling combined with multi-layer perceptron operations to extract both local and global features. MTGA-Net includes a branch-attention module that focuses on critical features of the mass, employing a dual-stage transfer learning approach. Initially, the system leverages the ImageNet dataset for general feature extraction, followed by fine-tuning on a specialized local mass patch dataset.
The system's interpretability and reliability are assessed through Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations, offering insight into model decisions. Empirical validation of MTGA-Net on the \hl{Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)} and INbreast dataset showed remarkable performance, achieving an AUC score of 0.98375 and 0.99311, respectively.
These findings underscore the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in medical imaging, establishing a new standard for breast cancer diagnosis and patient care.
